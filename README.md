# AutoSFX
Author: Lingxiao Fang

## Project Overview
This work introduced AutoSFX, an innovative system designed to automate the process of matching and synchronizing sound effects with video content. It comprises three primary modules: video analysis, audio-video synchronisation, and audio editing. By leveraging CLIP  and computer vision techniques, AutoSFX addresses the time-consuming nature of traditional sound effect editing in video production. It offers a fully automated workflow that enhances efficiency and bridges the gap between theory and application.The effectiveness of AutoSFX was demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
